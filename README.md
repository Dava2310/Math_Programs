The development of these programs started at November-December 2022.

In this repository, I save all my Math programs that I have developed over the years of my studies.


These includes methods like Gauss-Jordan, Jacobi, Seidel when we talk about lynear systems. Other methods include Muller, Bairstow, etc.


Thanks to:


a. To the Teacher and Ing. Alex Donado for all the effort in teaching me these methods. Without you, this repository wouldn't exist.


b. To my girlfriend who has supported me.


NOTES:


1- The programs that are in the Java lenguage, have been developed thanks to the IDE: Netbeans. Thanks to Oracle too.


1.1- In the actual version 1.0, there is not executable (.jar) so you need to open the project and compile it yourself._


2- The programs that are in the C++ lenguage, have been developed in Visual Studio code.


2.1- The compiler for that is Mingw64. Make sure that you have that compiler in the default route, so you can compile the program.


Or you can just use the main.exe file so you don't need to compile the program yourself.


Make sure to read the notes (if exists such file) in each program folder.

IMPORTANT:

If you find a bug or an math error in any of the programs, make sure to send me a message via email: dvetencourt23@gmail.com With the reason: "Bug found in Math Repository" with the next Information:


a. Which program you are using.


b. In case that the program you are using like Interpolation (To use Linear, Cuadratic or Polinomial), have different parameters to start the program, make sure to comment them.


c. What numbers or basically which exercise you put inside the program.


d. What is the expected result and what is the result that the program gave.


e. In case you know what is the fix, comment it below all of that information. I will test it, and make sure it works. Either way if you found a bug you will be in this repository descripction.
