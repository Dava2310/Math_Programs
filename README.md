In this repository, I save all my Math programs that I have developed over the years of my studies. 
These includes methods like Gauss-Jordan, Jacobi, Seidel when we talk about lynear systems. Other methods include Muller, Bairstow, etc. 

Thanks to:

a. To the Teacher and Ing. Alex Donado for all the effort in teaching me these methods. Without you, this repository wouldn't exist.
b. To my girlfriend who has supported me.

NOTES:

1- The programs that are in the Java lenguage, have been developed thanks to the IDE: Netbeans. Thanks to Oracle too.
1.1- In the actual version 1.0, there is not executable (.jar) so you need to open the project and compile it yourself.

2- The programs that are in the C++ lenguage, have been developed in Visual Studio code.
2.1- The compiler for that is Mingw64. Make sure that you have that compiler in the default route, so you can compile the program.
     Or you can just use the main.exe file so you don't need to compile the program yourself.

Make sure to read the notes (if exists such file) in each program folder.
