# Math_Programs

In this repository, I save all my Math programs that I have developed over the years of my studies. 
These includes methods like Gauss-Jordan, Jacobi, Seidel when we talk about lynear systems. Other methods include Muller, Bairstow, etc. 

Thanks to:

Teacher and Ing. Alex Donado for all the effort in teaching me these methods. Without you, this repository wouldn't exist.
